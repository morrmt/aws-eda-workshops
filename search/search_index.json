Through hands-on labs, we help you understand how to best take advantage of the Aurora platform's capabilities to effectively accelerate application development. Sign in to the provided AWS accounts \u00b6 At the beginning of the workshop you have been provided with a 12-character access code . This access code grants you permission to use a dedicated AWS account for the purposes of this workshop. Go to https://dashboard.eventengine.run/ , enter the access code and click Proceed . On the User Dashboard , please click AWS Console to log into the AWS Management Console. Click Open Console . For the purposes of this workshop, you will not need to use command line and API access credentials. Overview of labs \u00b6 Time permitting, you will run the following hands-on labs. Start with the prerequisites . # Lab Module Recommendation Overview 1 Prerequisites Required, start here Set up the lab environment and provision the prerequisite resources 2 Connecting, Loading Data and Auto Scaling Recommended, for provisioned clusters Connect to the DB cluster for the first time, load an initial data set and test read replica auto scaling. The initial data set may be used in subsequent labs. 3 Cloning Clusters Recommended, for provisioned clusters Clone an Aurora DB cluster and observing the divergence of the data set. 4 Backtracking a Cluster Recommended, for provisioned clusters Backtrack an Aurora DB cluster to fix an accidental DDL operation. 5 Using Performance Insights Recommended, for provisioned clusters Examine the performance of your DB instances using RDS Performance Insights 6 Creating a Serverless Aurora Cluster Recommended, for serverless clusters Create a new Amazon Aurora Serverless MySQL DB cluster manually. You may skip the provisioned cluster labs if you are planning to operate a serverless workload. 7 Using Aurora Serverless with Lambda Functions Recommended, for serverless clusters Connect to your serverless cluster using the RDS Data API and Lambda functions. Requires the previous lab. Lab environment at a glance \u00b6 To ensure everyone has a consistent experience, we have created a foundational template for AWS CloudFormation that provisions the resources needed for the lab environment. The environment deployed using CloudFormation includes several components: a Amazon VPC network configuration with public and private subnets a Database subnet group and relevant security groups for the cluster and workstation a Amazon EC2 instance configured with the software components needed for the lab IAM roles with access permissions for the workstation and cluster permissions for enhanced monitoring , S3 access and logging Custom cluster and DB instance parameter groups for the Amazon Aurora cluster, enabling logging and performance schema an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster with 2 nodes: a writer and read replica the master database credentials will be generated automatically and stored in an AWS Secrets Manager secret. a read replica auto scaling configuration a AWS Systems Manager command document to execute a load test Get started with the prerequisites \u00bb \u00b6","title":"DAT327 - Accelerating application development with Amazon Aurora"},{"location":"ee/#dat327-accelerating-application-development-with-amazon-aurora","text":"In this session, learn how to leverage the unique features of the Amazon Aurora platform to build faster, more scalable database applications optimized for the cloud.
